Led the development of a sophisticated classification algorithm within the car production domain, utilizing Kaggle's automotive dataset. 

## Introduction
Transportation is one of the most important aspects of modern life. Cars are one of the most common transportation used by many people. Car manufacturers are competing to produce and promote new products to meet the growing demand for new vehicles. One automotive business intends to launch a new car model into the market.

The sample data consists of information about cars that have been on the market. The attributes in this data have varying categorical values that indicate different levels of vehicle quality and features. A business intends to use this data to create a classification algorithm that can forecast the acceptance category of a new car based on these attributes. based on these attributes. A good choice for developing a classification model is a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which has proven successful in classification problems. The businessman hope that by using SVMs, they can make better decisions about whether their new cars are worthy of about whether their new car is worth promoting and selling, as well as being able to categorize such as "unacceptable", "acceptable", "good", or "very good".

The results of this classification analysis can be an important reference for the company's new car development, marketing, and sales initiatives. As a result, automotive industry players can increase their likelihood of success in the competitive automotive market.
